# Acknowledgement
Our code is built on the GAN implmentation of
[Which Training Methods for GANs do actually Converge?](https://avg.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/publications/meschedericml2018)
\[Mescheder et al. ICML 2018\].
This repo adds the VGAN and instance noise implementations, along with FID computation.


# Usage
First download your data and put it into the `./data` folder.

To train a new model, first create a config script similar to the ones provided in the `./configs` folder.  You can then train you model using
```
python train.py PATH_TO_CONFIG
```

You can monitor the training with tensorboard:
```
tensorboard --logdir output/<MODEL_NAME>/monitoring/
```

# Experiments

To generate samples, use
```
python test.py PATH_TO_CONIFG
```

You can also create latent space interpolations using
```
python interpolate.py PATH_TO_CONFIG
```
